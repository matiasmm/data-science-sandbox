It's a sandbox project to explore the concepts of data science learned from the book ["Data Science From Scratch: First Principles with Python"](https://www.amazon.es/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/149190142X) by Joel Grus.

It makes use of the code in this repo [https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch](https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch) from jupyther notebooks.
